<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Woah, you've found my website.
</p>

<p>
I'm Casey. I like to learn about new things. Sometimes I like to make things
too. Right now, I am studying computer science at Cal Poly. I am passionate
about a lot of stuff, including open source software, programming, and math.
For example, among other weird pursuits, I've probably wasted a couple days of
my life making my old Gentoo kernel config juuust right (only to realize I need
to re-re-compile in order to enable support for my USB microphone).

When it comes to programming, I tend to like fields that are highly technical.
I like the idea of diving deep into the stack, twiddling bits when necessary.
Operating systems, compilers, functional programming, and computer graphics are
areas that appeal to me for these reasons. This isn't to say that I think I am
an uber-genius that knows all these "highly technical" things. There is still
a lot I'd like to learn; but this is fine, because I like to feel like a
<a href="https://paulgraham.com/noob.html">noob</a>.
</p>

<p>
I made this website because I wanted to have a space online where I could be
myself. Traditional social-media outlets don't really appeal to me. Hope you
enjoy.

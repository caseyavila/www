<p>Just a website of cool things I've made.</p>
<p>I am currently a student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, majoring in computer science. I made this website from scratch in high school (I haven't really updated it since then) and have links to some of the stuff I've worked on here!</p>

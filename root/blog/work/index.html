<h1>What I want to work on</h1>
<p class="date">July 21, 2025</p>

<p>
Some of these things I don't yet know how to do. But everything I do know, I
once didn't.
</p>

<p>In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No, I don't want work on your payment processing system.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to implement SSA form for your high performance optimizing compiler.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to work on the NT kernel.</li>
  <li>No, I don't want to build your LLM system.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to write code that will end up in space.</li>
  <li>No, I don't want to only write test cases for code that will end up in space.</li>
  <li>No, I don't want to do data processing, whatever that means.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to figure out why splines made your video game 16% slower.</li>
  <li>No, I don't want to use React.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to write GPU drivers for Linux.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to dive into the assembly.</li>
  <li>No, I don't want to write B2B SaaS.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to make new hardware.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to have to refer to a specification or physics textbook before I can implement what you want in code.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to use Vulkan.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to create new algorithms.</li>
  <li>Yes, I want to change the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There's some flexibility. I'd still work on some of these no's, even if I
don't <em>want</em> to. The following might make me want to:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>Lots of autonomy</li>
  <li>Lots of ownership</li>
  <li>It's open-ended (figure out the tools and do what it takes and get the job done)</li>
  <li>I'm learning something new</li>
  <li>I won't be doing it forever</li>
</ul>

math, and philosophy. If you like what you read, send me an email (see the

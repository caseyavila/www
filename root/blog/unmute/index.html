<h1>Mute-by-default is why your video calls suck</h1>

<p>
At my previous job we had a meeting every morning where we'd join a video chat
and spend 15 minutes discussing what we worked on yesterday, what we'll work on
today, and anything blocking progress. I thought it was particularly useless
because most of the time nobody had anything additional to say, and we would
seemingly waste 15 minutes half-listening to each other (plus the time context
switching in and out of meeting mode). If someone did have something to say,
they were usually cut short because nobody likes a long stand-up.
</p>

<h2>An empirical discovery</h2>

<p>
One time we held the meeting in-person. It was the same meeting—we all took
turns going over the very same points—and yet it was different. Instead of
feeling like a contrived exercise, there was a lot more back-and-forth
discussion, and someone's issue was resolved on the spot. This was a very
subtle difference, and I hadn't made this realization until I thought about it
months later.
</p>

<p>
I've heard the idea that much of our communication is via body language, and
that the lack of these non-verbal cues is why video calls are tiring and
ineffective. I don't buy it. I've been in traditional phone calls and calls
playing video games for hours at a time without fatigue. What <em>really</em>
made my team's stand-up meeting suck was that it was <b>mute-by-default</b>
(normally you are muted, and you only unmute when it's your turn, or when
asking a question after someone completes their turn).
</p>

<p>
If you pay attention to conversations around you, you'll notice that there's
actually a lot of interruption. In theory, interrupting someone is rude, but in
practice, a good conversation is one that is dynamic—the feedback loop is
tight, interruptions are frequent, and actually increase the rate of
information transfer. Mute-by-default prevents all of this. You have to
consciously remember if you are muted or unmuted, and your sudden urge to speak
must first be redirected to finding the unmute button.  When we held our
meeting in-person, this overhead was eliminated and people chimed in when they
wanted (I'd still argue the meeting was unnecessary).
</p>

<p>
I've also seen the dynamics play out in class. In a normal college class I
could expect other students to ask a good amount of questions, or blurt out
corrections to the professor's math mistakes on the board. In my virtual
classes (or normal classes that go virtual for a session) participation would
always be nonexistent, and professors had to effectively torture us to get
interaction.  It's often a subconscious choice, but the added friction of
having to unmute your mic (and remembering to mute it after) makes not talking
so much more appealing.
</p>


<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>
If I had a company or led a team, I'd implement an <b>unmute-by-default</b>
policy. Unless you're doing something like a formal presentation (which is
mute-by-default in real life), everyone should be unmuted. If this seems like a
chore because only one person needs to talk at a time while everyone else
listens, reconsider whether the meeting has to exist in the first place. If
employees are in a loud, open-office environment, consider changing the
environment. Good communication is necessary for good work, and should not be
compromised (wasn't one of the "benefits" of an open-office plan better
communication anyway?).
</p>

<h2>Why's it like this?</h2>

<p>
It's also important to address <em>why</em> mute-by-default is the norm. In
addition to loud environments, there's a technological issue: latency. You know
those TV field reporters that respond after 5 seconds on the news? Imagine them
trying to have a back-and-forth conversation with the station. It would be
impossible. <em>To cope with this, news stations implement
mute-by-default.</em> You don't say anything unless you're absolutely sure the
person on the other end is done talking. We do the same thing. It's not as
obvious, but voice calls with high latency always feel a little awkward. There
are lots of little moments where people begin talking over each other without
realizing. But why cope when we don't have to?
</p>

<p>
Obviously the speed of light is a limiting factor, but if you asked me to guess
the priorities of corporate/school voice call offerings (think Zoom and Teams),
I don't think latency is at the top of the list. Certainly it is below
throughput. That's one of the reasons why mute-by-default is so common on these
platforms. On the other hand, communication software for gaming (think
TeamSpeak) is expressly designed for low latency (<em>"behind you!"</em>), and
I don't hear gamers complaining about how voice chat is tiring or ineffective.
</p>

<p>
Maybe we should just use phone lines.

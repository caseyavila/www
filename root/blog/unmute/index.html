<h1>Mute-by-default is why your meetings suck</h1>
<p class="date">February 2, 2026</p>

<hr>

<p>
Anything involving voice communication should be <b>unmute-by-default</b>.
Barring exceptional circumstances, everyone in the meeting should be unmuted at
all times.
</p>

<p>
When you tell people to mute themselves while others speak, they will fumble
over the unmute button when they finally have something to say. Or they talk
into the void for 30 seconds before anyone realizes. Eventually they realize
it's easier to stay quiet. The activation energy is too high. Everyone hates
it—the teacher forces students to answer questions, and the manager forces
employees to discuss what they did last week. It's called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_fatigue">Zoom fatigue</a>.
</p>

<p>
Good communication is necessary for good work, and the entire point of having a
conversation is to maximize bandwidth. If you like muting because your meeting
lends itself to taking turns or only listening, then maximum bandwidth isn't
necessary, and your meeting doesn't need to be a meeting. Try emailing or
messaging instead.
</p>

<h2>The source of our suffering</h2>

<p>
Mute-by-default exists largely because our software (think Zoom, Teams, etc.)
doesn't optimize for latency. The longer the delay between when you speak and
when others hear, the greater the chance someone else starts talking at the
same time. To cope with this, we invented the <em>protocol</em> of
mute-by-default, whereby you wait 5 seconds before speaking to make sure the
other person is actually done.
</p>

<p>
Phones have been popular for over 100 years, and yet I've never heard of
"landline fatigue."

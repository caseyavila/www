<h1>Solving a Rubik's cube from first principles</h1>
<p>August 2024</p>

<p>
Right after the end of this past school year, I decided to go back home and
take a short break from everything.  I just completed my third year of college,
and school, on top of a part time job (and all the other things college
students are up to) really adds up.  While I was home, I came across some old
childhood toys, including a few Rubik's cubes.  Seeing them almost surprised
me; it had been such a long time since I had even thought of a Rubik's cube.

<p>
As is common among (certain types of) kids, I had a Rubik's cube phase when I
was younger (think 4th or 5th grade). I was never the fastest at solving it,
but I remember having some friends that were <em>really</em> into it. I also
wasn't an uber-genius of a child, so ten-year-old me resorted to YouTube to
learn how to solve to cube.  With enough practice, I was able to learn the
beginner's method and get solves in around one minute. Still, one decade later,
a question remained:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Could I have solved the Rubik's cube from scratch?</strong>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, I had spoiled the puzzle for myself as a kid.

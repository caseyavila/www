Some of this stuff is from class over the years. A lot of it is just for fun.
For schoolwork, I've only included it in this list if I think it's worth a
mention.  If an assignment is on here, I probably thought it was hard, allowed
me to express myself creatively, or was just plain sick.

<p>
I can also think of a million other things I've done that I haven't had the
time to add here, don't really fit, or just don't remember. Stuff like creating
a blockchain client for my cryptography class, or math/programming puzzles that
I sometimes do. I might get around to it someday.

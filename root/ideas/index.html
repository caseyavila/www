"One more thing, about personal identity. Early on as a programmer, I was often
in situations like you describe. I didn't like what I was doing, I thought the
management was dumb, I just didn't think my work was very important. I would be
very depressed on projects, make slow progress, at times get into a mode where
I was much of the time pretending progress simply because I could not bring
myself to do the work. I just didn't have the spirit to do it. (I know many
people here know what I am talking about.) Over time I got depressed about
this: Do I have a terrible work ethic? Am I really just a bad programmer? A bad
person? But these questions were not so verbalized or intellectualized, they
were just more like an ambient malaise and a disappointment in where life was
going.

What I learned, later on, is that I do not at all have a bad work ethic and I
am not a bad person. In fact I am quite fierce and get huge amounts of good
work done, <em>when I believe that what I am doing is important.</em>"

"It's a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their backs on
building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning about Darwin or
Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made Darwin and Newton famous was
actually closer in spirit to building treehouses than studying for exams."

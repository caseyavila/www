One more thing, about personal identity. Early on as a programmer, I was often
in situations like you describe. I didn't like what I was doing, I thought the
management was dumb, I just didn't think my work was very important. I would be
very depressed on projects, make slow progress, at times get into a mode where
I was much of the time pretending progress simply because I could not bring
myself to do the work. I just didn't have the spirit to do it. (I know many
people here know what I am talking about.) Over time I got depressed about
this: Do I have a terrible work ethic? Am I really just a bad programmer? A bad
person? But these questions were not so verbalized or intellectualized, they
were just more like an ambient malaise and a disappointment in where life was
going.

What I learned, later on, is that I do not at all have a bad work ethic and I
am not a bad person. In fact I am quite fierce and get huge amounts of good
work done, <em>when I believe that what I am doing is important.</em>

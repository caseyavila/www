<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I'm Casey. I like to learn about new things. Sometimes I like to make things
too. Right now, I am studying computer science at Cal Poly. I am passionate
about a lot of stuff including programming, mathematics, hardware, and
open source.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to programming, I like fields that are highly technical. I like
the idea of diving deep into the stack, twiddling bits when necessary.
Operating systems, compilers, and performance appeal to me for these reasons.
</p>

<p>
Hope you enjoy.

<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Woah, you've found my website.
</p>

<p>
I'm Casey. I like to learn about new things. Sometimes I like to make things
too. Right now, I am studying computer science at Cal Poly. I am passionate
about a lot of stuff, including open source software, programming, and
mathematics.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to programming, I tend to like fields that are highly technical.
I like the idea of diving deep into the stack, twiddling bits when necessary.
Operating systems, compilers, functional programming, and computer graphics
appeal to me for these reasons.
</p>

<p>
Hope you enjoy.
